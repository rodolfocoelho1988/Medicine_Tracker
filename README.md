About the Software

Welcome to Medication Tracker. This application allows user to track down the medication information about patients.
The user could add, edit and remove patients and their medications. Also, the easy searching and ordering option helps to search information 
about a certain patient at a substantially fast rate.

Terms and Conditions of Use
---------------------------
I created this project as a way to test my knowledge of symfony and accompanying components.
I would request not to copy paste any code without mentioning my repository as a source since I spent a lot of time to create this project.

With that being said, you are welcome to view my code to get ideas for creating your own project. Enjoy!
